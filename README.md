# Qt-Cascade-App

## ‚ú® Project Overview

The **Qt-Cascade-App** is a powerful desktop application developed using the **Qt framework** and **OpenCV library**. It is designed to perform object detection tasks utilizing **Haar cascade classifiers**. With an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), users can load images or video streams, apply trained classifiers, and visualize detection results seamlessly.

## üîß Key Features

- **üîç Object Detection**  
  Detect objects such as faces, eyes, or custom-trained objects within images or video streams using Haar cascade classifiers.

- **‚è≥ Real-time Processing**  
  Supports real-time object detection for live video feeds.

- **üîê User-Friendly GUI**  
  Intuitive interface built with **Qt Designer**, enabling effortless loading of media, selecting classifiers, and viewing results.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Launch the Application**: Run the executable after building the project.
2. **Load Media**: Use the GUI to load an image or select a video source.
3. **Select Cascade Classifier**: Choose a pre-trained Haar cascade XML file for the object you wish to detect.
4. **Start Detection**: Initiate detection to process the media and visualize results in the display area.
